## Get Involved

See our guidance on [how to get involved](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Open Source

<p align="justify">
  Engineers accept phenomenal responsibility when dedicating their lives to improving our built environment. However, the vast majority of professional engineering software is, regrettably, closed source and proprietary. This is unfair and must change. Engineers should be offered the respect and freedom to inspect, validate and influence the algorithms used to design our buildings and bridges.

<p align="justify">
  Gazelle is proudly <a href="./LICENSE" target="_blank">open source</a>.
</p>

## Errata

<p align="justify">
  We consider structural engineering software to be safety critical. We strive to ensure stability, robustness and correctness throughout the source code, test suite and companion documentation. Nevertheless, we are human and mistakes are possible. Please submit error reports and suggestions for improvement via <a href="https://github.com/jsbayley/gazelle/issues" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a>.
