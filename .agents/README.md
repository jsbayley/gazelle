# AI Agents Documentation

This folder contains resources specifically designed for AI agents and orchestration tools working with Gazelle.

## Contents

- **`AI_INTEGRATION.md`** - Comprehensive guide for AI orchestration patterns, command-line interfaces, and integration examples
- **`schemas/`** - JSON schemas for model validation and structured data exchange

## Purpose

This folder serves as a central resource for:

1. **AI Agents** - Tools and documentation for autonomous engineering design workflows
2. **Orchestration Systems** - Patterns for batch processing, optimization loops, and design space exploration  
3. **Integration Partners** - Structured interfaces for external tools and platforms
4. **Validation** - JSON schemas ensuring data integrity in AI-driven workflows

## Quick Start for AI Development

```bash
# Navigate to AI resources
cd .agents/

# Review integration patterns
cat AI_INTEGRATION.md

# Examine model schemas
ls schemas/
```
